## üíæ Quickstart

### üîç Step 1. Install `Grammarly` language server through `NPM`

First, install the language server using NPM.

```sh
npm install -g @emacs-grammarly/grammarly-languageserver
```

### üîç Step 2. Configure your Emacs configuration

Consider adding this to your configuration.

```el
(use-package eglot-grammarly
  :ensure t
  :hook (text-mode . (lambda ()
                       (require 'eglot-grammarly)
                       (call-interactively #'eglot))))
```

If you use straight.el, you can also get this package directly from github.

```el
(use-package eglot-grammarly
  :straight (:host github :repo "emacs-grammarly/eglot-grammarly")
  :defer t  ; defer package loading
  :hook ((text-mode markdown-mode). (lambda ()
                                      (require 'eglot-grammarly)
                                      (eglot-ensure))))
```

## üîß Configuration

Create `.dir-locals.el` file in the the project root directory.

```el
((nil
  (eglot-workspace-configuration
   . ((@emacs-grammarly/grammarly-languageserver
       . ((audience . "knowledgeable")))))))
```

*P.S. See all possible configuration [here](https://github.com/znck/grammarly#extension-settings).*
